## Introduction

The Introduction section provides a more detailed overview of your project. It should explain the purpose, key features, and any other relevant information. This is where you can describe the problem your project solves or the goals it aims to achieve.

Example:
```
This project is a collection of machine learning models and utilities designed to simplify and streamline the process of building and testing various algorithms. It includes modules for clustering (KMeanClusters), classification (KNNClassifier), and regression (LinearRegression, LogisticRegression), along with essential tools for handling datasets, calculating metrics, and model selection.
```

## Project Structure

The Project Structure section provides a high-level overview of your project's organization. List and briefly describe each major component or directory in your project.

Example:
```
The project is organized into the following directories:

- **KMeanClusters:** Module for implementing K-Means clustering.
- **KNNClassifier:** Module for implementing K-Nearest Neighbors classification.

## Installation


Example:
```
1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/pyserve/pyserve.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd pyserve
   ```

3. Create a virtual environment:

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```

4. Activate the virtual environment:
